<div align="center">
  <h1><b>to-do's</b></h1>


A mobile-responsive app for listing to-do's implemented through HTML3, CSS3 and Javascript. Users can create to-do reminders and add them to projects. The app is checking for empty inputs and duplicates. Users can also categorize their to-do's by their respective project, see future to-do's only and even sort them by priority, title or date. The to-do's are styled depending on their priority. This app uses localStorage so users can check on their to-do's again anytime. Enjoy!
